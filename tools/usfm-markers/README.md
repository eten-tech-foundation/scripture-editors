# usfm-markers

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Usage

Run `nx generate markers-data` and when prompted give it a USFM style file URL, e.g. `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubsicap/usfm/refs/heads/master/sty/usfm.sty`

The 2 generated files are then manually copied from `packages\shared\src\utils\src\` to `packages\shared\src\utils\usfm\`.

## Building
